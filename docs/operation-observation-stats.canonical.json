This operation is focused on [Observation](observation.html) resources with valueQuantity elements that have UCUM unit codes.\n\nThe set of Observations is defined by 4 parameters: \n\n- the subject of the observations for which the statistics are being generated (`subject`)\n- which observations to generate statistics for (`code` and 'system', or 'coding')\n- the time period over which to generate statistics ('duration' or 'period')\n- the set of statistical analyses to return (`statistic`). \n\nPossible statistical analyses (see [StatisticsCode](valueset-observation-statistics.html)):\n\n - **average** (\"Average\"): The [mean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arithmetic_mean) of N measurements over the stated period\r\n - **maximum** (\"Maximum\"): The [maximum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximal_element) value of N measurements over the stated period\r\n - **minimum** (\"Minimum\"): The [minimum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimal_element) value of N measurements over the stated period\r\n - **count** (\"Count\"): The [number] of valid measurements over the stated period that contributed to the other statistical outputs\r\n - **totalcount** (\"Total Count\"): The total [number] of valid measurements over the stated period, including observations that were ignored because they did not contain valid result values\r\n - **median** (\"Median\"): The [median](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median) of N measurements over the stated period\r\n - **std-dev** (\"standard deviation\"): The [standard deviation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_deviation) of N measurements over the stated period\r\n - **sum** (\"sum\"): The [sum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summation) of N measurements over the stated period\r\n - **variance** (\"variance\"): The [variance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variance) of N measurements over the stated period\r\n - **%20** (\"20th percentile\"): The 20th [Percentile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percentile) of N measurements over the stated period\r\n - **%80** (\"80th percentile\"): The 80th [Percentile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percentile) of N measurements over the stated period\r\n - **4-lower** (\"lower quartile\"): The lower [Quartile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quartile) Boundary of N measurements over the stated period\r\n - **4-upper** (\"upper quartile\"): The upper [Quartile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quartile) Boundary of N measurements over the stated period\r\n - **4-dev** (\"quartile deviation\"): The difference between the upper and lower [Quartiles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quartile) is called the Interquartile range. (IQR = Q3-Q1) Quartile deviation or Semi-interquartile range is one-half the difference between the first and the third quartiles.\r\n - **5-1** (\"1st quintile\"): The lowest of four values that divide the N measurementsinto a frequency distribution of five classes with each containing one fifth of the total population\r\n - **5-2** (\"2nd quintile\"): The second of four values that divide the N measurementsinto a frequency distribution of five classes with each containing one fifth of the total population\r\n - **5-3** (\"3rd quintile\"): The third of four values that divide the N measurementsinto a frequency distribution of five classes with each containing one fifth of the total population\r\n - **5-4** (\"4th quintile\"): The fourth of four values that divide the N measurementsinto a frequency distribution of five classes with each containing one fifth of the total population\r\n\n\n\r\rIf successful, the operation returns an Observation resource for each code with the results of the statistical calculations as component value pairs where the component code = the statistical code. The Observation also contains the the input parameters `patient`,`code` and `duration` parameters.
