The set of Observations is defined by 4 parameters: 

- the subject of the observations for which the statistics are being generated (`subject`)
- which observations to generate statistics for (`code` and &#39;system&#39;, or &#39;coding&#39;)
- the time period over which to generate statistics (&#39;duration&#39; or &#39;period&#39;)
- the set of statistical analyses to return (`statistic`).

If successful, the operation returns an Observation resource for each code with the results of the statistical calculations as component value pairs where the component code = the statistical code. The Observation also contains the the input parameters `patient`,`code` and `duration` parameters. If unsuccessful, an [OperationOutcome](operationoutcome.html) with an error message will be returned.
